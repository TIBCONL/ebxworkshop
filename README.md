# Introduction

TIBCO Software helps you to unlock your potential of real-time data for faster, smarter decisions. Our Connected Intelligence platform seamlessly connects every application or data source and brings data together intelligently for better access, trust and control and predicts with confidence in real time and to scale. TIBCO introduces solutions for the most critical business challenges of our customers and shows how those are made possible through our Connected Intelligence Platform.

## TIBCO Connected Intelligence Platform

TIBCO Connected Intelligence platform is made up of three pillars: Connect, Unify and

Predict. Seamlessly connect any application, device or data source. Make sure that everything is accessible for your systems and people. By gaining access to data, improving this data and getting it to the right employees, channels, processes and devices, opportunities are unlocked. In addition to this surfacing insights and turning them into timely actions helps maximizing the business value. 



**Connect**

Connect all your data sources, appli-cations and people by means of API-led integration, irrespective of them being on-premise, or in the cloud. We enable developers and business users to build event-driven applications faster using new architecture patterns and low-code visual design tools to enable digital transformation. 

<img src=images/image125.png width="80%">

**Unify**

Intelligent gathering of data for better access, trust, transparency and control. Prepare your company with the trusted data you need to win. 

<img src=images/image89.png width="80%">

Digital organizations rely on data to stimulate exciting customer experiences, optimized business processes and innovative products. But to provide your business with the trusted data it needs to compete, is a huge challenge that is complicated by the demand for data and accelerated data silos.

With TIBCO Unify solutions you can optimize your data value chain and easily access, manage and share with more consistency and control.

**Predict**

Predict with confidence with real-time data-driven intelligence. Identify insights in real time, use intelligence for informed decision making and achieve better business results.

<img src=images/image137.png width="80%">

Successful modern organizations use the power of analysis and data science to extract meaningful intelligence and insights from data and to predict what will happen. By predicting and exploiting the opportunities discovered, these organizations innovate and optimize their organization, deliver great customer experiences and win in their markets.




## How do you bring all your data together?

Nearly every vendor in the data management space bandies about the term “360° views.” The concept is straightforward: a holistic, or comprehensive, view of the subject of interest. The challenge, however, is that not every vendor uses 360° in the same way. Some focus on the relationships in the master data, while others focus on transactional detail. Luckily, TIBCO handles both use cases. In the TIBCO EBX solution, data consistency requirements are met by enforcing consistency in the relationships, or connections, that customers create in and across domains. What this means is that 360° views are readily available by simply traversing all relationships. 

Every TIBCO product can integrate with any other capability found in the TIBCO portfolio. Combining data virtualization capabilities with MDM facilitates the creation of those blended 360° views some of our customers desire. In addition, by using data virtualization to build these blended 360° views, the federated queries gather the most up-to-date information on the fly. This means that the most accurate and up-to-date master data records (from EBX software) are combined with the most accurate and up-to-date transactional records (from TIBCO Data Virtualization software). This is different from the traditional approach of most 360° solutions, which rely on much more stodgy data stores and warehouses. In those situations, the freshness of the view is tied to the update cadence of the ETL/ELT operations.

# TIBCO EBX


## Why using a master data, reference data, or metadata solution?

If data is the new oil, then you’d better develop a superior way of refining it for efficient usage.

Data inconsistency and inaccuracy leads to process failure and poor analytics. MDM is how an organization’s most essential data—aka master data—is managed and linked to each other using a common architecture. MDM programs are business-led and include the people, processes, and systems to ensure master data is accurate and consistent. When you can manage and share all your data assets, you thrive.

MDM improves data quality, enables consistency, supports workforce collaboration, and provides the elusive “single view of the truth”. With one source of truth for all “entities”— data on customers, employees, products, and things, and a standard way to manage and show information hierarchies—you have an invaluable asset for a range of use cases, including customer experience, regulatory compliance, and data security and governance.

Master data is only one type of shared data asset in your organization. Other data assets include public and private forms of reference data and physical and business metadata. These data assets are all intrinsically linked so you'll need a solution that replaces the legacy, siloed application approach to data management with a unified data management architecture, where you can manage and share all data.

<img src=images/image134.png width="80%">

TIBCO EBX supports all enterprise data-driven use cases. Business processes come in multiple flavors. Operational business processes knit together the activities of the organization to create value. Analytical processes evaluate the performance of operations. And, governance processes control analytical and operational processes to ensure compliance with policies, regulations and laws. While each process type has different aims, their one commonality: data assets power them all. 

 




## Manage and share your data assets 

Your business teams need to manage and share a vast number of data assets—master data, reference data, conformed dimensions, hierarchies, and metadata. The dynamism and sophistication of your data means business teams can no longer rely on simple office automation tools or outdated data management tools to manage these assets. They need EBX.

EBX makes it easier to manage your data assets. Custom applications and purpose-built MDM solutions are hard to change while EBX is flexible and agile. EBX uses a unique what-you-model-is-what-you-get design approach, with applications generated on the fly and fully configurable. This eliminates the need for long, costly, and endless development projects. And EBX includes all the enterprise-class capabilities you need to create data-driven applications. Data stewardship, workflow, data quality and data integration are built right in.

 <img src=images/image135.png width="90%">
 




## Configure your data management applications

With EBX, you use a model-driven approach to design data management applications. Then configure only the features you need. Model-driven design simplifies change management. Updates require configuration changes, not coding.

 <img src=images/image139.png width="99%">

Everything you need is built-in and available in one unified software. No need to install multiple proprietary toolkits. When publishing changes to your models and configurations, the EBX engine instantiates the underlying data storage, user interfaces, policies and data services




## TIBCO EBX is an ‘all-in-one’ platform

**Master Data Management**

Every transaction in your organization is built on master data: products, customers, employees, suppliers, financial hierarchies or reference data. Accurate and consistent master data streamlines your operational processes and increases the quality of your reporting and analysis. EBX simplifies multidomain master data management by providing one way to manage, govern, and share all your master data.

**Reference Data Management**

Reference data is a special subset of master data that’s used for classification throughout your entire organization: postal codes, cost centers, financial hierarchies or countries. Whether the data is externally mandated or internally authored, it’s unambiguous and non-negotiable. EBX is a single solution for managing and distributing your reference data. By centralizing control, you ensure that consistency and compliance are maintained.

**Data Modeling & Metadata**

EBX includes built-in data modeling capabilities that are accessible through EBX’s browser-based user interface. We designed the EBX data modeling tool to be easy-to-learn, easy-to-use and simple-to-deploy so that your business and IT teams could collaborate throughout the model definition process. Our belief is that greater collaboration between your teams will lead to more accurate master and reference data domain definitions.

## What you will learn

In this workshop you will meet the capabilities that are needed to use, and manage data in an efficient way. You will work with data of Organizations, Customers and Products and will be able to look at detail information about your assets, to filter and search data in an easy to use and understandable way to avoid data inconsistency and inaccuracy. 

You will see historical data and the ability to compare data modifications from the past. You will see how easy it is to exchange data. You will work with hierarchies in different ways and see how you can profit from this way of presenting data. You will see how to visualize the master data and its data model. By looking at all your master data you have an invaluable asset for a range of use cases, including customer experience, regulatory compliance, and data security and governance.

You will view domains from a geo and index perspective. Besides this, every domain has its own preferences. From a products perspective you will look at product data and how this can be used, visualized and compared. 

MDM programs are company-led and include the people, processes and systems to ensure the master data is accurate and consistent. Built-in dashboards and KPIs about the completeness of the data give you insights into this completeness at the end of this workshop. 

When you can manage and share all your data assets, you thrive!

Good luck and enjoy this workshop.

Congratulations! Let’s start the exercises in EBX.




# Guided Lab 2: Company 


## Task 1: Examining your company attributes

Let’s click on the Company domain to illustrate EBX user interface features.

<img src=images/image148.png width="60%">

The right part of the screen is the associated content. In this example, a list of companies, and all the available features.

<img src=images/image149.png width="60%">

On this example, we have 445 companies.

<img src=images/image146.png width="60%">

This screen is automatically generated by EBX, because it’s a model driven tool.

It means that you can exactly define the structure (the model) of the information that you want to manage. To do this, the first step is to define a company in o   ur context. 

<img src=images/image147.png width="60%">

In this example, we have defined that a company is composed of: an MDM Id, a Name, a Legal Entity Identifier, a Main activity sector, a Parent, ...


<img src=images/image162.png width="60%">

This part of the screen is called the “toolbar”. EBX generates a default toolbar, but you can as well configure your own, for example to place links to custom features.



<img src=images/image163.png width="60%">



But EBX does not only generate the user interface. It also generates features to help you manage your data. Let’s expand this “Actions” menu. 



<img src=images/image160.png width="60%">


Here are some features automatically generated by EBX. Of course, these features are based on the permissions (the access rights) of the user. You can compare records, create and update, physically delete, validate the compliance of your data based on the technical and business rules that you’ll have defined, etc.



<img src=images/image26.png width="60%">



Let’s take a look at the feature called “View history”.



<img src=images/image28.png width="60%">

This feature gives you an access to the audit trail. Whenever something happens inside EBX (creation, update, deletion), the effect is shown here.



<img src=images/image170.png width="60%">



Thanks to this feature you can understand not only what has been done...



<img src=images/image22.png width="60%">

… but also, who has done the change (the user or the application).  

<img src=images/image25.png width="60%">
 


View History shows when the change was done and also what has been changed (highlighted in green for creations, yellow for updates, and red for deletions).



<img src=images/image20.png width="40%">




## Task 2: Filtering and comparing

Search filters are also available on the history.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



But you can also do a search on the transaction date, for example to answer such question: “What are the changes that have been done last month?”



<p id="gdcalert20" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

And even search based on the user or the application that has done the change.



<p id="gdcalert21" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



You can even restore (rollback) from the history, for example if a mistake has been made.

Finally, this history is also stored in EBX database, and fully available thanks to SQL requests (for example to feed a Data Warehouse).



<p id="gdcalert22" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of5.png).

## Task 3: Exchanging Data

Let’s go back to our main “Actions” menu.



<p id="gdcalert23" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert24">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Now, let’s speak about integration capabilities.

By default, EBX generates different interfaces to let you import/export data.

In terms of files, here is the list of supported formats:



*   CSV and XML, mostly for technical exchanges between EBX and your applications
*   XLS/XLSX, for business users



<p id="gdcalert24" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert25">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Excel files are key for business users. 

But collaborative work is not easy with it, and it complexify your governance processes.

By using EBX, you won’t have to tell your users that they have to abandon it.

They’ll have the ability to export data from EBX, work on it in Excel, and finally import it back to EBX. 



<p id="gdcalert25" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert26">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Another format is also available with Data Exchange but not configured here: SQL

You can import data from an external database, or even push data to another database using SQL requests.



<p id="gdcalert26" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert27">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



In terms of real-time exchanges, EBX also generates Web Services in SOAP and REST. 

Almost all the features available in the user interface are also exposed as Web Services.



<p id="gdcalert27" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert28">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

Finally, additional integration capabilities can be added, thanks to the use of EBX public API (for example to call another application from EBX).



<p id="gdcalert28" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert29">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)


## Task 4: Advanced Search

Now let’s discuss about EBX search features. 



<p id="gdcalert29" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Each attribute of the underlying data model is available as a search criteria.

For example, we can look for a company based on its name. 



<p id="gdcalert33" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert34">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

Based on the attribute type, various operators are available.



<p id="gdcalert34" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert35">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Of course, you can combine the criteria. For example, we can also search on the Country.



<p id="gdcalert35" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

As this attribute has been defined as a list of values in the data model, we can directly select among available values. 



<p id="gdcalert36" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs.

The user doesn’t have to know where the information is located. EBX will search in all available attributes. Be careful, by default here, no attributes are selected. Don’t forget to click on “Select all” if you want to illustrate this feature.

The third type of search is called the “Validation Search”. When you define an EBX data model, you don’t only define the information structure. You can also define technical and business rules to validate the data quality. EBX provides a validation engine that will check in real-time that your data are compliant with these rules.



<p id="gdcalert39" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Different severities can be defined for your rules. This feature allows you to directly filter on the validation result, based on the severity, or on the error message. Here EBX is telling that the data have not been validated. The reason is that the setting to automatically validate the data at startup has not been activated here, in order to reduce the EBX booting time.

And finally, EBX also provides a “Fuzzy Search”. Here the idea is to retrieve data that are approximately what a user or an application has requested. 



<p id="gdcalert41" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs.

This search is fully configurable. You can choose the attributes on which the search should be done, the algorithms that should be used (based on phonetic, on distance, etc.), and also the minimum score that should be used by EBX to consider a potential match.

Now, let’s switch one letter. Instead of “paribas”, let’s search for “paribos”.

To make search features directly available for users, you can also configure a link in the perspective.

EBX keeps an history of the previous searches. It is important to quickly re-launch a previous search.

## Task 6: Company Parent

But it’s not the case for the “Main activity sector” nor the “Parent”. These attributes have been defined as “Relations” (foreign keys) in the data model.  It means that we want to display a list of values. 



<p id="gdcalert58" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs.

Let’s take a look at the “Parent” attribute. The meaning of this information is to be able to specify that a company can have a parent company (if the current company is a subsidiary for example). There is no limitation in terms of relations inside EBX. Relations can target the same object (recursive relation) or any object inside EBX (and whatever the domain that contains it!).

As you can see here, the information can be organized in different tabs.

## Task 7: Company Address

Even though EBX generates automatically the user interface, you still have the ability to overwrite/customize it. This is an example of Google Maps integration (any other external service provider can be used), to display the company on a map, based on the address information.



<p id="gdcalert66" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of6.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of6.png "image_tooltip")




You can also use an external provider to normalize the address. Enter an address in the dedicated field, it will be validated by the Google API.



<p id="gdcalert67" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of7.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of7.png "image_tooltip")




The address has been normalized, extra information has been added (Latitude and Longitude), and the map has been updated. Please keep in mind that this is just an example, but that this behavior can be implemented with any external service.

If you remember, relations between your objects can be defined on the data model. These relations can then be used to change the way the information is displayed. For example, we can use a hierarchical representation. Here, 2 predefined hierarchical views are available.

Hierarchies are computed on the fly, based on the data and the relations. In the data model, a country is linked to a region. So here, this view has been configured to display the companies per country per region.



<p id="gdcalert73" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert74">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of9.png "image_tooltip")




A level can be easily expanded.



<p id="gdcalert74" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert75">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

Any level that contains some elements can be expanded. Here, we can also notice that a lot of countries does not have any counterparties related. So, we can ask EBX to “clean” this view to only display countries that have some counterparties attached. 



<p id="gdcalert75" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert76">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

To only display elements that have “children” is what we call the “Pruned mode”.



<p id="gdcalert76" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert77">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

Only relevant countries are displayed. But we can also use other dimensions to display the data, to have another point of view on the data.



<p id="gdcalert77" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of10.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert78">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of10.png "image_tooltip")



## Task 9: Hierarchies – subsidiary view

Let’s use the “Subsidiary View”. We want to see how our companies are related and have a different “angle” on the data.



<p id="gdcalert78" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert79">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

The same data are displayed using another dimension. It’s another point of view on the data.



<p id="gdcalert79" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert80">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of11.png "image_tooltip")


Important facts on hierarchy:



*   They are fully dynamic (computed on the fly)
*   There is no limitation in terms of number of levels
*   There is no limitation in terms of number of elements per level



<p id="gdcalert80" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of12.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert81">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of12.png "image_tooltip")




Another important thing is that hierarchies are not only a way to visualize data. You can also directly manage your data using this mode. If you click next to an element, a contextualized menu will be displayed.



<p id="gdcalert81" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert82">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Of course, these actions are also based on the user access rights.

As you can see here, you can for example:



*   Export data
*   Create an element at the right location
*   Move an element from a parent to another 



<p id="gdcalert82" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of13.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert83">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of13.png "image_tooltip")





## Task 10: Hierarchies – create a new view

These features are really useful, for example if you manage employees that are linked to business units, and you want to manage a company reorganization. Thanks to this capability you can quickly change the business unit of an employee selection.



<p id="gdcalert83" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of14.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert84">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of14.png "image_tooltip")




At any time, authorized users can also create new views. To do that, they can go to the “View” menu, and click on “Create a new view”.



<p id="gdcalert84" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

You can document your view (for example to explain the purpose).



<p id="gdcalert85" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



As users are usually part of a team, it can be useful to share the view definition to other users. It means that this view will then be available in the view menu for these users.

By default, users and roles are coming from EBX default directory. But of course, EBX can be plugged to any enterprise directory (AD, LDAP, ...)



<p id="gdcalert86" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Then we can select the view mode:



*   Simple tabular view: to define which columns should be displayed, or to filter the records
*   Hierarchical view: to display data using different dimensions

Here, we are going to use the 2nd mode. 

Select “Hierarchical view” and click on “Next”.



<p id="gdcalert87" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



EBX detects the potential dimensions that can be used (based on a data model introspection).

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

For example, let’s use the “Main activity sector”. It means that we want to group our companies per “Main activity sector”. 

<p id="gdcalert89" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

Click on “Create and apply” and the view will be created.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

Our companies are now displayed using a new dimension.

![alt_text](images/Copy-of15.png "image_tooltip")




But inside EBX, hierarchical views are not the only way to display data relationships.

As you have seen, hierarchical views are “mono dimensional”, because you always use one dimension per level (You can see your companies by activity sector or by country, but not a combination of both). To answer this need, a 360° view is also available.

Let’s go back to the default view, by clicking on Companies.



<p id="gdcalert92" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs.

## Task 12: Visualize – data model

It’s available at the table level

So, we have seen that EBX can provide different ways to see your data (tabular, hierarchical, graphical). But additional features can be added thanks to the use of the dedicated public API.

Let’s see some examples. Click on “Companies”.



<p id="gdcalert103" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of17.png).

# Guided Lab 3: Modifing your data model

By performing this exercise, you can change your data model by adding a validation rule field and viewing your new updated data model. EBX automatically adjusts the user interface for users. Under the hood, a generated custom service is now also available.


## Task 1: Data model – add field with validation rule

To change the data model, you need to change perspective first. 



<p id="gdcalert104" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of18.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert105">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of18.png "image_tooltip")




In this new perspective modify the database by selecting [CPTY] Companies.



<p id="gdcalert105" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of19.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of19.png "image_tooltip")


The table [CPTY] Companies shows you information about the defined attributes for the table, used Roles, Reference data and Technical data. Select Companies to see the defined attributes.



<p id="gdcalert106" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of20.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of20.png "image_tooltip")




Now you see the content of the table. Shown are the grouped fields referring to Identification, Additional information, Address et cetera.



<p id="gdcalert107" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of21.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of21.png "image_tooltip")


Create a new field under the Group ‘Addition information’ after the last existing field.



<p id="gdcalert108" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of22.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of22.png "image_tooltip")




Add a new mandatory Date field ‘addInfoValDate’ and give it a label that will be show in the UI. Since EBX is multilingual labels can be added in different languages. 

<p id="gdcalert109" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of23.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of23.png "image_tooltip")


After you ‘Create’ the new field it is now shown in the table. Besides the ‘Main’ information about the field, you have now the possibility to add ‘Simple controls’, ‘Advanced controls’ and ‘Advanced properties’ about this field.



<p id="gdcalert110" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of24.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of24.png "image_tooltip")




Now add a validation rule on the field to make sure that the entered date from the UI needs to be equal or greater than today – the date of today will be showed.



<p id="gdcalert111" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: error handling inline image </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert112">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>



To be able to see and use this field make sure the right access properties are set. 



<p id="gdcalert112" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of25.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert113">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of25.png "image_tooltip")




Now it is essential to publish the changed data model. 

<p id="gdcalert113" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of26.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert114">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of26.png "image_tooltip")


This is done in a few steps where EBX shows what changes in which datasets are published.



<p id="gdcalert114" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of27.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert115">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of27.png "image_tooltip")




Press Publish again.



<p id="gdcalert115" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of28.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert116">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of28.png "image_tooltip")


You are done! Your data model publication has succeeded. You can close now.



<p id="gdcalert116" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of29.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert117">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of29.png "image_tooltip")



## Task 2: Data model – view updated data model

All the changes you have done can be viewed as well. Change your perspective back to Master data.



<p id="gdcalert117" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of30.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert118">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of30.png "image_tooltip")


Select companies and look at the changed data model.



<p id="gdcalert118" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: error handling inline image </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert119">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>





Your data model looks like it did not change at all. Make sure you synchronize your modifications in the graph. Press Load and confirm.



<p id="gdcalert119" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of31.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert120">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of31.png "image_tooltip")




<p id="gdcalert120" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of32.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of32.png "image_tooltip")




Click on the plus-sign in front of the ‘additional information’-group and you will see your added field colored in green. 



<p id="gdcalert121" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of33.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert122">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of33.png "image_tooltip")





## Task 3: Data model – select record to view updated screen and populate new field

Select a record in the companies table. You now see the new field ‘Valid Until Date’ appearing under the group ‘Additional information’. If you update this record, you immediately will see that this new field is mandatory and that you have to enter a value. Otherwise it will result in an error. 



<p id="gdcalert122" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of34.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert123">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of34.png "image_tooltip")


Enter the right value. See also what the format is of the field and ways there are to enter a value. 



<p id="gdcalert123" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of35.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of35.png "image_tooltip")



# Guided Lab 4: Customer 


## Task 1: Customer feature – display data geo

We have here 2 examples of custom features to display the data. Let’s use the first one to start.



<p id="gdcalert124" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert125">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Custom view based with Google Maps.

<p id="gdcalert125" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of36.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert126">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of36.png "image_tooltip")





## Task 2: Customer feature – display data index

And now let’s see another example.



<p id="gdcalert126" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert127">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



This view is called the “index”. This is another example of things that you can do using EBX public API. The idea is that you can browse your data based on the first letter of the company name. Let’s directly access the companies that are starting with the letter “J”.



<p id="gdcalert127" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)




# Guided Lab 5: Products 


## Task 1: Products – product data

We are directly positioned to the companies starting with the “J” letter. Let’s see another example, that is available on the “Burgers”. Click on “Burgers”, and select “Products”.



<p id="gdcalert128" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Here we manage a list of “Burgers”. Let’s double click on the first line to access the record details.



<p id="gdcalert129" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of37.png).

![alt_text](images/Copy-of37.png "image_tooltip")




As you can see here, EBX gives you the ability to attach documents to your data (images, pdf, videos, etc.). This feature is provided by the Digital Asset Manager module. When you define your data model, you’ll have a “Media” type, to let you associate documents to your data. 

Documents are not stored in EBX database, it will only store the link to the document.

They are stored in a “Drive”, which is by default a folder on the application server that is hosting EBX.



<p id="gdcalert130" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert131">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



But here, what we want to illustrate is a feature that is not “out-of-the-box”. If you remember, we presented the history feature, to display the audit trail. This screen is sometimes a bit too complicated for a business user, because it displays technical information. Thanks to the EBX public API, we can make it user friendly. Please click on this button.



<p id="gdcalert131" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Here we can easily understand what happened. And it’s also possible to understand what happened in terms of relations. Click on the “Ingredients - Products - History” tab, to understand how the ingredients were added to this product.



<p id="gdcalert132" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



Here we can easily understand what happened, i.e, how the product was built. Let’s see another example of what you can do with the public API. The feature is available at the “Products” table level.



<p id="gdcalert133" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs.

## Task 2: Products – mosaic

Let’s launch the feature called “Mozaic”



<p id="gdcalert134" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



This is another way to display the data. The idea here is to display the products by using the associated picture. You can click on a picture to access the product details. But let’s go back to the “Products” and see a final example.

<p id="gdcalert135" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)




## Task 3: Products – compare

Select some products.



<p id="gdcalert136" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

In the “Actions” menu, select “Compare products”.



<p id="gdcalert137" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert138">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

Out-of-the-box, EBX provides a comparison feature. But this feature has some limitations:



*   Limited to 2 records
*   No comparison of associated data (for example here, Ingredients, Menus, …)
*   Maybe too technical for business users

So, the idea here is to mimic what you can find on Web Sites (like Amazon for example).



<p id="gdcalert138" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of38.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert139">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of38.png "image_tooltip")




Now, let’s illustrate another EBX feature, which is about KPIs and Dashboard management.

Click on “Dashboard”, located under “Companies”.



<p id="gdcalert139" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert140">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)




# Guided Lab 6: Dashboard 


## Task 1: KPI Dashboard

This screen displays KPI results.

These KPIs are coming from a library of indicators that are provided by EBX.

These indicators are basically on 2 things:



*   The data quality (Completeness, Errors, Duplicates, …)
*   The activity (Average Workflow execution time, Longest task in a Workflow) 



<p id="gdcalert140" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert141">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



The idea is that you can place these KPIs wherever you want, define when they should be computed (real-time when a dashboard is displayed, on-demand, …), and then configure Dashboards to directly display the KPI results. Each user can have access to multiple Dashboards. To go further, you can also code your own KPIs and add them to the library.



<p id="gdcalert141" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)



As the KPI results are stored in the database, they can be accessed directly at the database level using SQL requests, for example to feed Analytics solutions or any other application.
